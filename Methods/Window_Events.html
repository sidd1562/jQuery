      Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
      storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes
      the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for
      its appearance. HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With

      structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as
      headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML elements
      are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as
